# Hack and Slash - Project Game


This project was developed as part of the coursework for a class focused on video games. I undertook this project independently, leveraging a variety of tutorials found across the internet to guide my development process. The game incorporates pre-made assets, including textures and sound effects, sourced from available asset packs. I built all the game mechanics from scratch, with the exception of the boss segment, ensuring a unique gameplay experience. Below, I have included several GIFs to showcase the gameplay and provide a glimpse into the game's dynamics. It's important to note that this project will not be made publicly available nor will it be further developed or continued.

In this project, the leveling system is designed in such a way that it tracks the number of defeated enemies. Upon reaching a certain threshold, the player's character gains strength and vitality, facilitating further progression in the game.

Items in the game are organized within a database, containing key information such as damage output (DMG), gold value, item icons, etc. Although the system does not accommodate for an automatic increase in item level as the player progresses, a mechanism has been implemented where weaker items only appear up to a certain point in the game. Beyond this stage, players can find significantly better equipment.

Skills in the game have base parameters such as damage and vitality, which can be enhanced by equipping specific items, like weapons.

One of the basic skills is launching a fireball, which inflicts area damage. The base damage of this skill is set at two points.

Chests in the game introduce a randomness element, offering players items drawn from a specified pool, adding an element of surprise and variety to the gameplay.

Enemies are designed to pose a challenge that grows with the player's level. Certain types of enemies, upon spotting the player's character, initiate a chase and inflict direct damage (melee DMG), forcing the player to remain vigilant and adapt their combat strategy.
