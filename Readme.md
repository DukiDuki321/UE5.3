# Hack and Slash - Project Game


This project was developed as part of the coursework for a class focused on video games. I undertook this project independently, leveraging a variety of tutorials found across the internet to guide my development process. The game incorporates pre-made assets, including textures and sound effects, sourced from available asset packs. I built all the game mechanics from scratch, with the exception of the boss segment, ensuring a unique gameplay experience. Below, I have included several GIFs to showcase the gameplay and provide a glimpse into the game's dynamics. It's important to note that this project will not be made publicly available nor will it be further developed or continued.
